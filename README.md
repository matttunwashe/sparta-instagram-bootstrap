# sparta-instagram-bootstrap

**Brief**
--------
Your task is to RE-BUILD the instagram homework from scratch with bootstrap. You must create a new repository and follow the git hub practises.

**Difficulties**
-----
* It was tricky to put contents into the desired container (md column) but I understood it after much practise.
* Need to be cautious when giving the class / id names. I tend to forget the names because I didn't name them meaningfully.

**What I'm pleased with**
----
* Great undestanding of the bootstrap grid system.
* Better understanding of file path.
* Slightly better code indentation.
